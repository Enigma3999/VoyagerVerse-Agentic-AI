# VoyagerVerse Demo Instructions

## For Non-Technical Viewers

### Step 1: Start the Demo

1. Double-click the file named `start_demo.bat` on your desktop
2. Wait about 10 seconds for the server to start

### Step 2: View the Demo

The demo will automatically open in your browser with two tabs:

**Tab 1: Traveler Experience**
This shows what Tom and Priya see on their phone when VoyagerVerse detects extreme heat and Priya's headache, automatically rescheduling their desert safari.

**Tab 2: Behind the Scenes**
This reveals how the agentic AI works, showing the autonomous decision-making process that makes VoyagerVerse unique.

### Step 3: Explaining the Demo

Key points to highlight:

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: VoyagerVerse detects problems and solves them without being asked

2. **Emotional Intelligence**: The system detects Priya's headache and factors this into its decision

3. **Contextual Awareness**: The system monitors the extreme heat (45.2Â°C) and determines it's unsafe

4. **Complete Solution**: VoyagerVerse doesn't just cancel plans - it finds alternatives, reschedules, and explains everything

### Step 4: Closing the Demo

When you're finished, close your browser and press Ctrl+C in the command window that opened.
