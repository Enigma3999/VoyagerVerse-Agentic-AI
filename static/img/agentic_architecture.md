**Description:**
- **User Interaction:** Users provide input and receive feedback via the web UI.
- **Perception Layer:** Gathers real-time data (weather, events, preferences) using tool-calling (APIs or synthetic data).
- **Reasoning Layer:** The agentic core evaluates plans, constraints, and goals based on context.
- **Action Layer:** Executes bookings, sends notifications, and updates plans as needed.
- **Learning Layer:** Continuously updates the user's preference model and adapts future recommendations.
- **Feedback Loop:** All decisions and learning are made transparent to the user, who can intervene at any stage.

## How to Use in Slides
- Copy the Mermaid code block into any tool that supports Mermaid diagrams (e.g., VS Code, Mermaid Live Editor, Notion, HackMD, etc.).
- Export as PNG/SVG for your presentation, or screenshot the rendered diagram.
